# Kinda ![Build status](https://github.com/batkot/kinda/.github/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

Small experimental library exploring higher-kinded polymorphism and transformer/MTL-like monad compositions.

F# implementation of higher-kinded polymorphism emulation inspired by
- [Lightweight higher-kinded polymorphism paper](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf)
- [Higher](https://github.com/palladin/Higher)
- [transformers](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers)
- [mtl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2)
